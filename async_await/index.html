  <h1>Asynchronous &Synchronous</h1>
  <p>Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and
    still
    be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has
    finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.</p>
  <p>Synchronous programming is when the program runs in a specific order.</p>
