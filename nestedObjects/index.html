    <h1>Nested Objects</h1>
    <p> Nested objects are objects that are inside of other objects. They are accessed using dot notation.</p>
    <p>For example, if we have an object called <b>person</b> with a property called <b>name</b>, we can access the name
        property
        like this:</p>
    <pre id="code">person.name</pre>
    <p>If the <b>name</b> property is an object itself, we can access its properties like this:</p>
    <pre id="code">
    person.name.first
    person.name.last
    </pre>

    <p>Nested objects can be used to represent complex data structures, such as a person's address
        or a product's inventory.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of a nested object representing a person's address:</p>
    <pre id="code">
    const person = {
        name: "John Doe",
        address: {
            street: "123 Main St",
            city: "Anytown",
            state: "CA",
            zip: "12345
        }
    }
    </pre>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
